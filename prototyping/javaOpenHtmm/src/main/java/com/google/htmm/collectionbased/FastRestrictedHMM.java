//The FastRestrictedHMM class is an implementation of an efficient algorithm
//for inference (computing marginal probabilities and likelihood) in a special
//case of HMM.
//It is designed for HMMs with matrix transition of a special form as
//described in the paper "Hidden Topic Markov Models" available at:
//http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~amitg/aistats07.pdf
//Throughout this code we use the standard alpha and beta recursions:
//alpha_t(i) = Pr(y_1,...,y_t,q_t=i ; param).
//beta_t(i)  = Pr(y_{t+1},...,y_T | q_t=i; param).
//T is the length of the markov chain,
//y_t are the observations at time i, q_t is the (discrete) state at time t,
//param is the set of parmeters of the markov model.
//We assume the reader is familiar with inference in HMMs and with the
//above mentioned paper.


//Assumptions:
//(1) The transition matrix is of the special form described in the HTMM paper,
//i.e. consists of entries that depend on theta and epsilon only
//(2) sprobs is a vector of T vectors, each of which has states=2*topics
//entries and is already allocated when Forward Backward is called.
//(3) Theta is a probability vector of length topics.
//(4) Local is a vector of T probability vectors, each of which is of length
//topics and contains the emissions probabilities.
//(5) pi is a probability vector of length states=2*topics and specifies the
//prior distribution on the first hidden state in the chain.

//Design Issues:
//We might want to have a base HMM class and derive FastRestrictedHMM from it.
//pros:
//we can easily switch between different implementations of HMM.
//cons:
//this is not a general HMM implementation, it is not suitable whereever HMM is
//suitable.
//the interface of the initialization is different from standard HMM.
